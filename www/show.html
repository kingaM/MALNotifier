<b>A short description:</b></br>
After awakening her powers as Tamayori-hime, http://anidb.net/ch40708 [Tamaki] and her guardians had apparently succeeded in sealing away Onikirimaru. However, http://anidb.net/ch40711 [Takuma]`s body starts to change as the demon blood flowing through his veins consumes him. While the relationship of the guardians is undergoing stress, Logos resumes their activity once more.
